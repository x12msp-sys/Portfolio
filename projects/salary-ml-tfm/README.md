# Salary Prediction — Master's Thesis (TFM)

End-to-end ML on a Data Science salaries dataset (2020–2025).  
**Focus**: transparent modeling and explainability to support compensation planning.

## Key points
- EDA with clear feature notes (location, experience level, company size/type).
- Model comparison (RandomForest, XGBoost); best by MAE and R².
- Explainability: feature importance + commentary.
- Optional **Gradio** demo.

## Reproducibility
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train.py
```
